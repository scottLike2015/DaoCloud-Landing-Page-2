Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred by you, but may be assigned by us to any party at any time without notice to you. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing. These Terms of Use and any other agreements between the parties entered into through the Site and the Platform shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York , without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. Except for proceedings commenced by DaoCloud to protect its intellectual property or confidential information which may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, the parties mutually agree that any and all disputes arising hereunder shall be resolved exclusively by state or federal courts located in the State of New York.

Please read these Terms of Use carefully. By clicking “I Accept” below, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Use.</p>

          <p class="privacy-para">By accessing or using the Site or the Platform you acknowledge and represent that you: (i) have read these terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference, (ii) understand them, (iii) accept and agree to be bound by them; (iv) are at least 18 years old or older, (v) are able to form legally binding contracts, (vi) agree to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to you, to the use of the Site and the Platform, and/or the Internet, (vii) are a Professional (as defined below), or a principal, partner, officer, or other authorized representative of an organization fully authorized to bind Professional to contractual obligations, and (viii) have the necessary certifications, registrations, and licenses required by the applicable law and you are in good standing and qualified to provide services as a Professional.

          <p class="privacy-para"><strong>THE PLATFORM DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.</strong> The Platform, the Site, the DaoCloud Content and all Third Party Materials are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something made available to you through the Site or the Platform. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or 911 immediately. DaoCloud does not recommend or endorse any specific tests, providers, products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be made available to you through the Platform or the Site. Reliance on the Platform or the Site or any material made available to you through the Platform or the Site is solely at your own risk.</p>

          <p class="privacy-para">Some of DaoCloud’s other sites, applications, services and tools may have additional terms that we provide to you when you use those sites, applications, services or tools.</p>

          <h2>The Platform</h2>

          <p class="privacy-para">Through the Platform we offer a holistic health network that connects holistic health providers (each, a “Professional”) with interested users of the Platform (each, a “Member”). Members can interact with Professionals and other Members, discover products from third party websites and access and post educational information related to health and wellness through the research portal.</p>  

          <p class="privacy-para">You agree that you will only ask a Member to join your network if such Member is a current client.  However, if a Member that is not a current client initiates the request to “connect” with you and join your network, you may accept such a request.</p>

          <p class="privacy-para">For so long as you agree to these Terms of Use and abide by them, you may use the Site and the Platform.   Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and use the Platform and any DaoCloud Content (defined below) that we may specifically identify within the Platform as available for download as a Professional.  You agree that in addition to these Terms of Use, the DaoCloud Content may be subject to additional licensing terms available to you upon download. You understand that if, upon download of any DaoCloud Content, you are prompted to additional terms applicable to such DaoCloud Content you must review and accept such additional terms before we allow you to proceed with your download.  Please read any additional terms carefully.</p>

          <h2>Registration</h2>

          <p class="privacy-para">In order to become a Professional you must register by creating an account. During the registration process, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, and biographical and professional information, and create a username and password for your account. You represent and warrant that all registration information you submit is truthful, complete and accurate and you will maintain the truthfulness, completeness and accuracy of such information. If we believe or suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may deny or terminate your access to the Site and the Platform (or any portion thereof) and any license(s) granted hereunder. You may not transfer to or share your account with other persons or entities, and you are solely responsible for the confidentiality of your user account, as well as for its use and misuse. You agree (i) to be responsible for any act or omission of any users accessing the Site or the Platform under your account that, if undertaken by you, would be deemed a violation of these Terms of Use, and (ii) that such act or omission shall be deemed a violation of these Terms of Use by you.  You will promptly inform us of any need to deactivate a user name or password, including if you become aware that your account is being used without authorization.</p>

          <p class="privacy-para">You agree not to register for an account on behalf of an individual other than yourself, or register for an account on behalf of any group or entity unless you are authorized to bind such person, group or entity to these Terms of Use. By registering another person, group or entity you hereby represent that you are authorized to do so. Individuals or entities whose access to the Site or Platform has previously been terminated by DaoCloud may not register for a new account and may not designate others to register or use an account on their behalf.</p>

          <h2>General Restrictions on Use</h2>

          <p class="privacy-para">When using the Site, Platform or DaoCloud Content, you will not (and will not permit any third party to):  (i) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discern the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or interface protocols of the Platform or the Site; (ii) introduce into the Platform or the Site any virus, worm, “black door,” Trojan Horse, or similar harmful code; (iii) upload to the Platform or the Site any Professional Generated Content (defined below) that violates the Community Guidelines (defined below) set forth in these Terms of Use; or (iv) otherwise use the Platform or the Site in violation of these Terms of Use.  If you violate any of these Terms of Use,  we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to deny you access to the Platform or the Site, or any portion of thereof, without notice, and to remove any of your Professional Generated Content.</p>     

          <h2>Fees for Subscriptions</h2>

          <p class="privacy-para">As a paid subscriber, you agree to pay all fees and charges associated with your subscription on a timely basis.  Professional subscriptions are billed annually.</p>

          <p class="privacy-para">Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, your subscription will automatically renew each year and your credit card will be charged at the then-current annual subscription fee, plus applicable tax, to the payment method provided by you, unless you cancel your subscription by providing written notice to team@daocloud.com. Your obligation to pay fees continues through the end of the subscription period during which you cancel your subscription. Professionals agree to pay the applicable fees for access as a Professional to the Platform (including, without limitation, periodic fees for such accounts) as they become due plus all related taxes, and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interests for any overdue amounts. Failure to pay may result in the termination of your subscription.</p>

          <p class="privacy-para">From time to time, DaoCloud may offer Professionals certain incentives in exchange for the Professional receiving a one-time, annual subscription at no charge to the Platform.  For example, if a Professional invites a certain number of Members to join the Platform, DaoCloud may offer the Professional a one-time, one-year subscription at no charge.  After the one-year subscription expires, all other payment terms apply to the Professional’s continued use of the Platform.</p>

          <p class="privacy-para">DaoCloud uses a third-party provider for payment services, and such provider may not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment.  If the payment method you use with us, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel your account or such subscription services, you authorize us to continue billing that payment method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase. We do not guarantee refunds for lack of usage or dissatisfaction.</p>

          <h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>

          <p class="privacy-para">In the course or accessing and/or using the Site and Platform, we may obtain information about you or you may be required to provide certain Personal Information (as that term is defined in the Privacy Policy) to us.  All uses of your Personal Information by DaoCloud will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which forms an integral part of these Terms of Use.  If you use the Site or Platform, you are accepting the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, as may be amended from time to time. If you do not agree to have your information used in any of the ways described in the Privacy Policy, you must discontinue use of the Site, the Platform and the DaoCloud Content.</p>

          <h2>Usage of Data</h2>

          <p class="privacy-para">You shall not, directly or indirectly, use for your own benefit (other than to fulfill your obligations hereunder or to Members who may be your clients outside of the Platform, and then only in accordance with the privacy policy maintained by Professional (“Professional Privacy Policy”) and all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including without limitation HIPAA to the extent applicable) or disclose to any third party any data made available to you through the Platform regarding a Member without the prior written, express permission of the applicable Member. DaoCloud does not have, and does not assume, any responsibility for the confidentiality of communications between Members and Professionals, other than those expressly stated in our Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use that you accept, or any responsibility for a violation of HIPAA by you.</p>
