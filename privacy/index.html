<p>We at DaoCloud LLC (“DaoCloud,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy describes the information collection and use practices of DaoCloud in connection with our online platform (the “Platform”), which is made available to you through our website at www.daocloud.com, and which may include your use of the Platform or website entered via tabs or portals accessible via social sharing sites, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology (the Platform together with the website, collectively, the “Site”).</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information collected offline and does not alter the terms of any other agreement that you may have with us.  The terms of this Privacy Policy are incorporated by reference in the Terms of Use that you accept upon registration for the Platform (the “Terms of Use”).  Through your use or access of the Site or your acceptance of the Terms of Use, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy, as may be amended from time to time.

<strong>Information We Collect</strong> 
<p>
Personal Information” is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person.  We do not collect any Personal Information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us.  When you sign up to use the Platform, either as a Member or a Professional, you will be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information.  The Personal Information we request may depend on whether you are signing up as a Member or a Professional, and such Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, business address, state of residence, title, license and place of employment.  We may also collect Personal Information, such as your name and email address, when you visit our Site and request information or submit comments. 
</p>
<p>
When we collect payment information directly from you, like credit card numbers and expiration dates, we transmit this data directly from you to the credit card processing company and it is not stored by DaoCloud.

<strong>Usage Information, including Cookies</strong>
<p>
As you interact with the Site and the Platform, we may use automatic data collection technology and services to record and collect information that identifies your computer, to track your use of our Platform, and to collect certain basic information about you and your surfing habits. This information may include information about your operating system, your IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, keywords, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of a website you visit, and other similar information concerning your use of the Platform (the “Usage Information”).</p>

 
<p>
We collect this Usage Information by using cookies and pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs). Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web site members.  You can reject cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet provider’s “help” file.  If you reject cookies, you may still visit the Platform and Site, but you may not be able to use some areas of the Platform or the Site. The Usage Information is collected and used in aggregate form.  We do not collect Personal Information in this way, but if you’ve provided us with Personal Information we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically.</p>

 
<p>
Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.  If third parties provide such analytics services and software, the third parties may also receive the information collected and their use of such information is governed by their privacy policies.</p>

<strong><i>Do Not Track Requests</i></strong>
<p>
At this time, we do not have the technological capability to respond to “Do No Track” signals, and the Site may therefore collect any information that an end user’s browser provides, such as information identifying the end user’s operating system and Internet protocol address.</p>

<strong>Treatment and Use of Personal Information and Wellness Information; Sharing Authorization</strong>

<p>The Platform provides Members the ability to communicate with Professionals and other Members of the Platform.  Members’ communications with such individuals through the Platform may include Personal Information and/or information that relates to your past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition (“Wellness Information”).  Members (and not DaoCloud) are solely responsible for deciding whether to share and for sharing their Personal Information and/or Wellness Information with Professionals or other Members of the Platform.  When you add Members and/or Professionals to your network, you are granting such users access to view your profile.
</p>
 

<strong>Members may select from the following options provided in the privacy settings for the Members account:</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>Members can set their profile as “hidden,” meaning that other Members and Professionals cannot view the Member’s profile in any form unless the Member or Professional has been added to a Member’s network.</li></p>
<li>
<p>Members can set their profile as “searchable,” meaning that other Members and Professionals can search for such Member and view that Member’s limited profile (which includes the Member’s name, thumbnail image of the Member’s profile picture and zip code).</p></li>

<li><p>Members can set their profile as “open,” meaning that other Members and Professionals can search and view the Member’s full profile, regardless of whether they have been added to such Member’s network.</li></p>
<p>
</ul>
Professionals can set their profile as “public,” meaning that Members, other Professionals and non-DaoCloud users can view the Professional’s full profile.
</p>
 
<p>
In addition to the specific uses set forth in the “How We Use Your Information” section below and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Members authorize DaoCloud to disclose Wellness Information to those individuals and entities to whom Members have granted access to view their Wellness Information.

<strong>Information We Share with Third Parties</strong>

We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties to enable them to market to you.
